<p>
The game will be an endless runner which generates a randomzied roads that turn and meander through the world.
Along the way there will be a number of obstacles and decisions that the player will need to make in order to
survive. They will be given a gun with recharging ammo that they can use to break and avoid obstacles as well
as score points at their leasure. Players can choose to change their route by shooting marked targets indicating
the direction of there choice. Failure to shoot any of these marked targets will result in a game over.
